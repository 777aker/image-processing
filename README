hw06: Image processing

Kelley Kelley
CSCI4239/5239 Spring 2022

Expanded from ex09 with some stuff from ex10
It basically takes a few passes and makes image from
camera a lot more pastel and sobel have a lot less random dark spots
also you can increase shadows which makes red where the light is
and blue where the shadows are (only mode 3)
mode 0 is so you can compare sobel and what I did
other modes are just testing and cool effects I left in

Time spent: 7 hours

Key bindings:
  ESC exit
  - go back one mode
  + go forward one mode
  arrows change position
  pgup/pgdown zoom
  s/w change shadow multiplier for mode 3
